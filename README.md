# How it works ⬇️
**Step 1:** Download or Clone the code!  
**Step 2:** Run it!  
**Step 3:** It will ask you to enter message text,receiver's whatsapp number, and time to send it.

# Note  
The only drawback it has is the program should run in background till it send's the message. If you stop the program or clone the window it won't send!   
You must be logged in in web whatsapp before running this program! as it uses web whatsapp to send message.
